    "## Result Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the outlined analysis methodology, we will discuss the results as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Total number of venue comparison between Manhattan and Central Toronto:   \n",
    "    (1) Both Manhattan and Central Toronto show similarities in large numbers of diverse venue in their neighborhoods, reflecting their leading business and cultural center status in their respective countries.   \n",
    "    (2) However, based on individual neighborhood venue data comparison, Manhattan has order of magnitude more of total number of venue, reflecting that Manhattan has much more number of neighborhood (40 for Manhattan and 9 for Central Toronto) and much higher working and residential population than Central Toronto.    \n",
    "    (3) Based on the above comparison, there should be good location options for new business office and family home in Central Toronto. However, the selection options in Central Toronto could still be much less than Manhattan since the total number of venue options in Central Toronto is much less than the total number of venue in Manhattan.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Venue ranking information and their implications:    \n",
    "    (1) For Financial district in Manhattan, the top ranking venues include coffee shop, hotel, and various restaurants, reflecting those venues serving working and traveling populations. Will select new busienss office location options in Central Toronto with the similar venue ranking.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (2) For high-end residential neighborhood in Manhattan, such as Upper East Side next to famious New York Central Park, the top venues include restaurant, exhibit and art gallery, and fitness facilities. These venues are also preferred by the busienss manager for their new family home location optons in Toronto.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (3) To match the venue preference, the new business office location will clearly be at relatively small area of financial district in Central Toronto where there are high concentration of office buildings, hotels, restaurants and coffee shop.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (4) For family home location options in Central Toronto, the choices could be relatively hard to match Upper East Side neighborhood in Manhattan that are close to Park, musium and restaurants. Although downtown area in Central Toronto could offer good restaurant and musium venue, but downtown could be far away fro large park venue comparable to Manhattan Central Park. On the other hand, the large park venue in Toronto could be more available in a far distance areas from Toronto downtown and from restaurant and musium venues.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3. K-means venue clustering results and their implications:     \n",
    "    (1) K-means venue clustering analysis provides consistent results with those from venue ranking analysis. It provides convincing confirmation regarding observations from the venue ranking analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (2) In addition, the clustering results reveal that the neighborhood of Davisville North offers good venues of Park, grovery shopping and dancing and fitness facilities. Such venue availability could be suitable for new family home location in Central Toronto.\n",

    "## Recommendations:   \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above result discussions, we will propose the following recommendations regarding potential location options in Central Toronto for US business manager to consider:    \n",
    "    (1) For new business office in Central Toronto, the clear option is at the financial district of Central Toronto, with plenty venues of office building, hotel, and restaurants.    \n",
    "    (2) For new family home, the potential location options could be in the neighborhood of Davisville North or Davisville, where there are revnues of park, grocery shopping,  restaurants and fitness facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for further study:    \n",
    "    (1) After presenting the project, need to solocit feedbacks from the US business manager and his company's decision makers.    \n",
    "    (2) To verify and to evaluate location options, suggest to arrange visits to Central Toronto by the US business manager and his family.    \n",
    "    (3) May need to expand this project to inlcude other important factors in location selection, such as cost and transportation convinince. \n"

    "Although Toronto also offers large number of venue for business and family life, comparison to Manhattan in New York, there are still some limitations, especially for family home location considerations. There coudl be tradeoff considerations to balance the preference for various venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the report presents recommendations, it also suggests to further improve this study by getting feedbacks, arranging visits to Toronto, and to consider other important factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "With further iterative data analysis and evaluation, we believe that Toronto could offer very satisfactory options for both new business office and family home selection."
